        <h1>Climate Change and Renewable Energy</h1>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      
      <p>Climate change is one of the most important global problems of today, and the transition to renewable energy sources is of critical importance to reduce the effects of this problem. This project examines the relationship between CO2 emissions per capita and the use of renewable energy sources. By analysing data sets related to global CO2 emissions and renewable energy use, our purpose is identifying trends and solutions for promoting sustainable energy practices. With visualizations and data-based insights, we try to provide a extensive overview of the current state of renewable energy use and its effects on decreasing the carbon footprint.</p>

      <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
    </section>
      <p>In order to do this, we took the total amount of electricity production of countries by year and the amount of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. Then, by dividing these two data into each other, we found the ratio of the amount of electricity generated from new energy sources to the total amount of electricity production, and using these ratios, we created the following map. Where you can see the yearly electricity production from renewable sources over total electricity production for the countries.</p>

      </ul>
      <p>After that we wondered has the use of renewable energy sources increased in America due to the clean air act signed in America in 1963 and how CO2 emissions would be affected if they were increased. 
        In order to satisfy our curiosty we took the data of use of renewable sources beggining from year 1960 to now for United States. Then we created a line chart below.

      <p>We can see that the use of renewable sources has been increasing in United States. But, does this affect the CO2 emissions in United States? To have the answer of this and also make prediction for the future we have created the scatter plot of yearly CO2 emissions per capita. Then we fitted a regression line but the line was not satisfying. So we changed the lineer regression line to a second degree polynomial line.</p>

      <h2>Code Examples</h2>
      <p>Here are some code examples used in the project:</p>
      <div class="code-block">
        <pre><code>
          # Python code for data loading and cleaning
          import pandas as pd

          data = pd.read_csv('climate_data.csv')
          data.dropna(inplace=True) 
        </code></pre>
