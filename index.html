        <h1>Climate Change and Renewable Energy</h1>
    </div>


    <div class="section">
      
      <p>Climate change is one of the most important global problems of today, and the transition to renewable energy sources is of critical importance to reduce the effects of this problem. This project examines the relationship between CO2 emissions per capita and the use of renewable energy sources. By analysing data sets related to global CO2 emissions and renewable energy use, our purpose is identifying trends and solutions for promoting sustainable energy practices. With visualizations and data-based insights, we try to provide a extensive overview of the current state of renewable energy use and its effects on decreasing the carbon footprint.</p>

      <h2>Data Analysis</h2>
    </section>
      <p>In order to do this, we took the total amount of electricity production of countries by year and the amount of electricity generated from renewable energy sources. Then, by dividing these two data into each other, we found the ratio of the amount of electricity generated from new energy sources to the total amount of electricity production, and using these ratios, we created the following map.</p>
